# ActivityTracker

ActivityTracker is a Minecraft server modification built on the SpigotAPI platform. It is used to track a player's level of activity and determine if they're inactive.

The database currently stores a user's play time in milliseconds. This should be converted to minutes and then be used to determine a player's activity.
The back-end is implemented, now some fancy commands and/or maybe a web interface should be implemented.
